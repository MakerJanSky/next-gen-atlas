## Motivation

With DAI already present and profitable on Ethereum, resources to promote USDS are best spent on new markets, where USDS does not compete with DAI. To this end, the Integration Boost program should direct 100% of its budget to venues and partners outside of Ethereum, where USDS has the highest potential for growth that is not at the expense of DAI.

## Edited Atlas Documents

Sections shall be amended as below (changes in **bold** or ~~strikethrough~~):

Section A.5.2.1.2
The Accessibility Facilitator can work with Ecosystem Actors to set up mechanisms that provide additional rewards to DeFi lending protocols **outside Ethereum** that integrate USDS. The rewards must be calculated offchain to be equivalent to the USDS Savings Rate on their unutilized USDS, and must be delivered through the native liquidity mining mechanisms of the lending protocols, or similar systems.

The Integration Boost can also be delivered to other forms of DeFi protocols than Lending Protocols, as long as there is a reasonable equivalence in how the integration boost helps grow **crosschain** USDS adoption.

The Integration Boost is delivered through a multisig that the Accessibility Facilitator can request to have topped up to 3 million USDS through Executive Votes whenever necessary to ensure the Integration Boost is delivered successfully.

Since the Integration Boost is delivered with a lag, for strategic integrations, the Accessibility Facilitator may choose to provide an extra high Integration Boost, to encourage rapid adoption and prevent the Integration Boost value from getting low during the early growth phase.

**Integration Boost is not permitted to be used to promote USDS adoption on Ethereum.**
