## Motivation

Enforcing anonymity of delegates has had a demonstrably negative effect on governance participation. Today there are so few active delegates that it takes only 4 MKR to become a Prime Delegate and receive compensation.

Delegates have shown they will sharply curtail their participation in discussions in order to limit the possibility of accidentally giving away identifying information. This leads to poorer quality governance, because no substantive discussion occurs on the forum.

The overall delegate set has dwindled. When the anonymity requirement was put in place, there were many delegates. Of the 17 currently listed in the Atlas, only half a dozen appear to still be actively voting. Requiring delegates maintain strict anonymity prevents new delegates from entering governance and attempting to attract delegation for fear of suddenly having all of their hard work negated by a slip up on the forum or onchain.

Institutions, registered investment advisors, and high net worth individuals have demonstrated a reluctance to delegate to anonymous delegates. The amount of MKR participating in governance has steadily declined since the requirement was put in place. Making anonymity optional may lower the barrier to some large MKR holders becoming engaged in governance.

The original justification for anonymity was security. This would only make sense if *delegators* similarly had to be anonymous. It is unlikely delegates themselves would be an attack vector on the protocol, when there are central points of failure in several key holders and MKR holders and custodians.

For facilitators, Maker already has one facilitator (covering all areas of responsibility other than governance) operating from an official address publicly tied to an identifiable individual. This has presented no problems to date, and demonstrates little need to eventually enforce an anonymity requirement on facilitators as well as delegates.

Finally, actively paying a bounty on doxxing Maker's own contributors is not a way to foster a healthy, collaborative work environment. Anonymity should be respected if freely chosen, but forced anonymity of delegates and facilitators is unnecessary and counterproductive.

## Edited Atlas Documents

Sections shall be amended as below (changes in **bold** or ~~strikethrough~~):

Section A.1.4.7
The Alignment Conserver roles of Facilitator and Aligned Delegate ~~require~~ **are permitted to utilize** anonymity and high levels of operational security. **Maintaining an anonymous identity is optional.** ~~Breaches of these anonymity and operational security requirements are considered serious misalignment. In the event of such breaches, the known identities of individuals holding these AC roles shall be promptly derecognized, and they will be barred from further participation as Alignment Conservers.~~

~~Section A.1.4.7.1~~
~~The Facilitator “Ecosystem” is exempt from the anonymity requirement, as well as the requirement of high levels of operational security insofar as the latter requirement relates to maintaining anonymity. This exemption applies solely to the Facilitator "Ecosystem", as they onboarded into the role prior to the ratification of Atlas v1 (March 27, 2023), which introduced the anonymity requirement for Facilitators.~~

Section A.1.5.11
The AD Buffer also serves as collateral for a whistleblower bounty. This bounty is capped at half of one month’s budget allocation. This bounty is payable to a whistleblower who responsibly provides evidence that is useful to the Facilitators’ investigation of ~~either 1)~~ misalignment by the AD ~~, or 2) a breach of the AD's operational security or privacy~~ .
