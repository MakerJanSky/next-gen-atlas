## Motivation

We currently require AD's to stay anonymous and even pay bounties for users to reveal their identities. This is likely a large reason AD's keep communications to a minimum to avoid being doxed. They cannot attend events in person, cannot speak personally, they are incentivized to participate less in Sky. They constantly have a target on their back. What the point of having a request for comments stage of Atlas proposals if people are pushed to never comment? I am pushing this proposal to make anonymity optional for AD's, they can choose whether they want to be anonymous or not, and the bounty system will be eliminated. Should any member ever be sued, we have a legal defense fund. I'm also going to include in this proposal funding emergencies to defend AD's such as if they need relocation or security. Going into the future we want active public governance, not cloak and dagger. Also on a practical note, why are we paying people to dox our delegates? That seems like a waste of money that can be better put to use elsewhere. We are not Silk Road and acting like it makes us seem criminal.

## Edited Atlas Documents

Sections shall be amended as below (changes in **bold** or strikethrough):

```
Section A.1.4.7
The Alignment Conserver roles of Facilitator and Aligned Delegate [s]require[/s] **are permitted to utilize** anonymity and high levels of operational security. **Maintaining an anonymous identity is optional.** [s]Breaches of these anonymity and operational security requirements are considered serious misalignment. In the event of such breaches, the known identities of individuals holding these AC roles shall be promptly derecognized, and they will be barred from further participation as Alignment Conservers.[/s]

~~Section A.1.4.7.1~~
[s]~~The Facilitator “Ecosystem” is exempt from the anonymity requirement, as well as the requirement of high levels of operational security insofar as the latter requirement relates to maintaining anonymity. This exemption applies solely to the Facilitator “Ecosystem”, as they onboarded into the role prior to the ratification of Atlas v1 (March 27, 2023), which introduced the anonymity requirement for Facilitators.[/s]

Facilitators and aligned delegates are considered a part of Sky and will be defended by Sky should they come under threat during the performance of their duties. 

Section A.1.5.11
The AD Buffer also serves as collateral for a whistleblower bounty. This bounty is capped at half of one month’s budget allocation. This bounty is payable to a whistleblower who responsibly provides evidence that is useful to the Facilitators’ investigation of [s]either 1)[/s] misalignment by the AD [s], or 2) a breach of the AD’s operational security or privacy~~[/s] .
