## Motivation

This Atlas Edit proposal aims to update the Atlas so Launch Project is no longer exempt from reporting requirements. This update is required by the Atlas. Section A.5.6.1.1 states that the Beta Launch is “the time at which three key elements will be unveiled: the new brand, USDS and SKY”. Section A.5.6.1.4.1. states that “The Launch Project must follow a higher standard of transparency after the Beta Launch, when the first impression of the new brand and the overall launch process has already been set.”

This Atlas Edit proposal correctly updates the Atlas to reflect the post-Beta Launch requirements of Launch Project.

## Edited Atlas Documents

Sections shall be amended as below (changes in **bold** or strikethrough):

Section A.5.6.1.4
~~The Launch Project is a one-time exception to the requirements for maximum end-to-end transparency for all governance processes, Facilitator decisions, and budget spending defined by the Atlas.~~ Due to the unique opportunity presented by the new brand and its well-coordinated release alongside the Beta Launch, the Launch Project must optimize for creating the best possible first impression, given its potential to have an outsized impact on the long-term success of the entire Ecosystem.

**The Launch Project must provide comprehensive quarterly reports on all spending. The Launch Project must also provide a high-level summary of ongoing spend the final week of each month.**

Section A.5.6.1.4.1
The Launch Project must follow a higher standard of transparency after the Beta Launch, when the first impression of the new brand and the overall launch process has already been set.

**The Ecosystem Facilitator must publicly report on the official Sky Ecosystem forum no later than April 30, 2025 with a complete, comprehensive breakdown of all expenditures by Launch Project to date. This should include a timeline of expenses at the monthly level as well as a summary of spend for 2023, 2024, and 2025-to-date for each category.**

**If this full reporting of past Launch Project expenses is not publicly available by April 30, 2025, no further funding may be provided to Launch Project and Ecosystem Facilitator until the full, public reporting of expenses has been published.**

**This pause in funding extends to both lump sum payments and any active funding streams. If active funding streams must be paused, and require action through an executive vote, then that pause must be included in the next non-emergency executive vote.**
